# ETL Testing Framework

Welcome to the ETL Testing Framework repository. This repository is designed to help you understand and implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) testing using various tools and frameworks. This guide will walk you through setting up your environment, understanding the repository structure, and getting started with your coding tasks.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- GitHub account
- Access to this repository

### Setup

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Codespace**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the `Code` button and select `Codespaces`.
   - Click `Create codespace on master`.

3. **Rebuild Container**:
   - Once the Codespace is created, click on `...` (three dots) next to your Codespace name in the Codespaces tab.
   - Select `Rebuild Container` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal in the Codespace.
   - Run the following commands to verify the setup:
     ```bash
     terraform --version
     python --version
     pip list
     ```

You should see the versions of Terraform and Python, and a list of installed Python packages.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`iac/`**: Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.
  - `.devcontainer/`: Configuration for the development container.
  - `main.tf`: Main Terraform configuration file.
  - `backend.tf`: Configuration for the backend state.
  - `outputs.tf`: Outputs configuration file.
  - `modules/`: Contains reusable Terraform modules.
    - `s3/`: Module for creating S3 buckets.
    - `dynamodb/`: Module for creating DynamoDB tables.
- **`great_expectations/`**: Configuration and scripts for Great Expectations.
- **`tests/`**: Python tests using Pytest and Boto3.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies.

## Using Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a cloud-based development environment. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Open Codespace**: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and open the Codespace.
2. **Start Coding**: Your environment is pre-configured with all necessary tools and dependencies. Begin coding directly in the Codespace.
3. **Commit and Push**: Make changes and commit them to your forked repository.

### Codespace Environment

The Codespace is set up with:
- **Python**: For running tests and scripts.
- **Terraform**: For managing infrastructure as code.
- **Great Expectations**: For data validation and testing.

## Coding Guidelines

To ensure consistency and maintainability, follow these coding guidelines:

1. **Follow PEP 8**: Adhere to the Python PEP 8 style guide.
2. **Write Tests**: Ensure your code is well-tested using Pytest.
3. **Document Your Code**: Write clear and concise documentation for your code.
4. **Use Version Control**: Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Ensure you are using the virtual environment for your Python dependencies:

```bash
source /opt/venv/bin/activate
